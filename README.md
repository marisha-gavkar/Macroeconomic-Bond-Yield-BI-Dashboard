# Macroeconomic Influences on Government Bond Yields – BI Dashboard

## Business Problem
Understanding what drives long-term government bond yields is critical for investors, policymakers, and financial institutions. 
However, macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, commodity prices, and debt issuance are often analyzed in isolation.

## Objective
To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes how key macroeconomic indicators influence the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield, enabling data-driven financial and policy insights.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Crude Oil Prices
- Government Securities Issuance Volume

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX
- Excel
- Public macroeconomic datasets (FRED, U.S. Treasury, EIA)

## Analysis Performed
- Time series trend analysis of yields and macroeconomic indicators
- Correlation analysis between CPI, crude oil prices, and bond yields
- Breakdown of government securities issuance types
- Forecasting of yield trends using Power BI analytics

## Key Insights
- Bond yields increased sharply during periods of rising inflation (2021–2025)
- Crude oil prices showed a positive correlation with yield movements, indicating inflation-linked effects
- Bond yields dropped significantly during recessionary periods (e.g., 2020 pandemic)
- Government debt issuance volumes increased during higher yield environments

## Business Impact
This dashboard enables financial analysts and decision-makers to:
- Monitor macroeconomic drivers of interest rate movements
- Identify inflationary signals impacting bond markets
- Support investment strategy and policy evaluation through interactive BI visuals

## Dashboard Preview
Screenshots of the Power BI dashboard are available in the `dashboard_screenshots` folder.

## Future Enhancements
- Regression-based forecasting using Python
- Integration of additional global macroeconomic indicators
- Machine learning-based yield prediction models
